            <h1>Natalie Christie</h1>
            <h2>Scrum Master</h2>
            <p>Natalie Christie is a transfer student on their third year at SFSU on track for a BS in Computer Science.
            Outside of working on projects they love participating in the arts (such as costuming, make up, etc) and
            have always had an appreciation for the aesthetics of things. They're really into spending time with their cat 
            as they work on projects and classwork.
